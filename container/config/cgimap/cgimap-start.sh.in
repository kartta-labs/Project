# Ugh.  Start cgimap using "env -i" to clear out all envioronment vars other
# than the ones explicitly set here, because it will crash with a cryptic
# 'unrecognized option' exception if any environment variable starting with
# "CGIMAP_" other than the ones it expects is set.  Kubernetes sets all kinds of
# environment whose name starts with "CGIMAP_", since we're using that as the
# name of several resources (deployment, image, service, etc).
