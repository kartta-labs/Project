# Load this file into your shell to switch to the k8s configs specified in the current deployment secrets file.
# Usage:
#    . ./gconf [ --vector | --clear ]
# If --vector is present, it will wwitch to the vector tile cluster rather than the web app cluster.
# If --clear is present, it will unset your active gcp project and k8s cluster config.
#
# Note this isn't an exectable script; it's a set of commands intended to be loaded into your shell.
# It sets environment variables in your shell.
#
# If you execute it via 'bash ./gconf' rather than '. ./gconf' (or 'source ./gconf'), it will still
# work but will not modify your shell's current enviroment.
